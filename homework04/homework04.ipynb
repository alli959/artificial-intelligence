    "### 1\\. [Pre-processing and parameter tuning in an SVM classifier, 20 points]\n",
    "The Statlog data set is an old benchmark in machine learning. It contains data from satellite images and the aim is to predict land type (red soil, cotton crop etc). There are 36 integer valued features and 6 classes. The file `sat.trn` contains the 4435 training examples and `sat.tst` contains 2000 test examples. Your task is to obtain an RBF-SVM classifier which obtains high classification accuracy on this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Evaluate the accuracy of a RBF-SVM obtained with default values for $C$ and $\\gamma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Scale the training set prior to training an RBF-SVM (scale the test data accordingly) and repeat the task from a).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Use cross-validation on the (scaled) training set to identify optimal values of $C$ and $\\gamma$. You should start with a coarse grid and then do another run with a finer grid. Logarithmically spaced grid values are often used. Evaluate  the accuracy of the resulting classifier by re-training using the best parameter values and report the error on the test set (why is the cross-validation error not a good estimate of the true classifier error here?)\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Using randomized search for hyper-parameter values has been shown to be more efficient than traditional grid search. Instead of evaluating parameter values at regular intervals, the values are sampled from a distribution over possible parameter values. This enables considerable time savings (exhaustive grid search is expensive), or the identification of better parameter values for a given computational budget. Repeat the parameter search using `RandomizedSearchCV`. You can either fix the budget (n_iter parameter) so that the cost is comparable to the exhaustive grid search in c), or set the budget to e.g. 10% of the cost in iii). Report the results of the best classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) For scaling the data, see: `preprocessing.StandardScaler` in scikit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The parameters $C$ and $\\gamma$ in SVMs are called *hyper-parameters* since they are considered to be fixed during optimization of the model parameters ($\\theta$-values). The procedure of selecting hyper-parameter values is referred to as *model selection* and is typically performed by training the model for several different values of hyper-parameters, and evaluating the resulting model on a (cross-)validation set and finally selecting the values that give the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) An exhaustive search of parameter combinations on a grid is called is referred to as a *grid-search*. The `GridSearchCV` class in scikit-learn makes this easy to do. For details see the scikit documentation, sections 3.1 (Cross-validation: evaluating estimator performance), 3.2 (Tuning the hyper-parameters of an estimator) and the \"Parameter estimation using grid search with cross-validation\" example.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The paper *Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization* by Bergstra and Bengio describes why randomized search of hyperparamter values is an efficient strategy. https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf\n"

    "Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship (QSAR) models relate the activity of chemical compounds to their structural properties. The activity can represent e.g. the potency of a drug or its toxicity. The structural properties may contain basic information such as i) the fraction of carbon atoms in the compound, ii) the spatial arrangement of atoms in the compound and iii) quantities computed from quantum mechanical simulations (*ab-initio* calculations).\n",

    "\n",
    "a) Using `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`, obtain a classifier for predicting whether a given compound is readily biodegradable or not. Use a random 80/20 train/test set split for evaluting the performance of your classifier. Report the confusion matrix for the test set and calculate the accuracy of the classifier together with *sensitivity* and *specificity* (see below).\n",

Construct a training data set for the stage 2 model by sending the *validation* set (not the original training set) through each of the stage 1 models, resulting in an `n_val` by 4 matrix $X_2$ of prediction values. Train a linear regression model for stage 2 on $(X_2, y_\\text{val})$.\n",

This has some drawbacks as detailed in the lecture notes and one-hot-encoding is generally preferred. This is most conveniently done by using `pd.get_dummies` with `drop_first=True`. For this particular data set, direct application of one-hot-encoding does not necessarily improve performance.\n",
