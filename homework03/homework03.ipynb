    "In recent years, spam on electronic newsgroups has been an increasing problem. Here, you will\n",
    "build a classifier to distinguish between \"real\" newsgroup messages, and spam messages.\n",
    "For this experiment, a set of spam emails and a set of genuine newsgroup messages have been obtained.\n",
    "Using only the subject line and body of each message, we’ll learn to distinguish\n",
    "between the spam and non-spam.\n",
    "All the files for the problem are in the file `email_spam.zip`.\n",
    "In order to get the text emails into a form usable by a off-the shelf classifier, some preprocessing on the\n",
    "messages has already been performed. You can look at two sample spam emails in the files `spam_sample_original`,\n",
    "and their preprocessed forms in the files `spam_sample_preprocessed*`. The first line in\n",
    "the preprocessed format is just the label and is not part of the message. The preprocessing\n",
    "ensures that only the message body and subject remain in the dataset; email addresses\n",
    "(EMAILADDR), web addresses (HTTPADDR), currency (DOLLAR) and numbers (NUMBER)\n",
    "were also replaced by the special tokens to allow them to be considered properly in the\n",
    "classification process. (In this problem, we’ll going to call the features \"tokens\" rather than\n",
    "\"words,\" since some of the features will correspond to special values like EMAILADDR.\n",
    "You don’t have to worry about the distinction.) The files `news_sample original` and\n",
    "`news_sample_preprocessed` also give an example of a non-spam mail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work to extract feature vectors (i.e. classifier inputs) out of the documents has also been done for you, so you\n",
    "can just load in the design matrices (called document-word matrices in text classification)\n",
    "containing all the data. In a document-word matrix, the $i$-th row represents the $i$-th document/email,\n",
    "and the $j$-th column represents the $j$-th distinct token. Thus, the $(i,j)$-entry of\n",
    "this matrix represents the number of occurrences of the $j$-th token in the $i$-th document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we’ve chosen as our set of tokens considered (that is, as our vocabulary)\n",
    "only the medium frequency tokens. The intuition is that tokens that occur too often or\n",
    "too rarely do not have much classification value. (Examples tokens that occur very often\n",
    "are words like \"the\", \"and\", and \"of\", which occur in so many emails and are sufficiently\n",
    "content-free that they aren’t worth modeling.) Also, words were stemmed using a standard\n",
    "stemming algorithm; basically, this means that “price,” “prices” and “priced” have all been\n",
    "replaced with “price,” so that they can be treated as the same word. For a list of the tokens\n",

    "200, 400, 800 and 1400 and for the full test set as well. What conclusions can you draw from the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comments*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) To read the training and test data and the list of tokens behind the features use\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    trainMatrix, tokenlist, trainCategory = readMatrix('MATRIX.TRAIN')\n",
    "    testMatrix, tokenlist, testCategory = readMatrix('MATRIX.TEST')```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) To use the `sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` class, you start by calling the `fit` function which solves the SVM optimization problem for the given training set. You then either call `predict` to get predictions for the test set (or other data points) and subsequently evaluate the error rate/accuracy for the classifier \"manually\"; or you call the `score` function which performs the two operations (prediction and evaluation) in one go. This is completely analogous to how all the classifiers are used in scikit-learn. The Jupyter workbook vika02_logreg.ipynb shows how this is done with the logistic regression classifier."

    "b) [Feature importance, 10 points] In feature selection (a.k.a. input variable selection) the goal is to identify which features are most relevant for a given classification task. By performing a careful selection of features, the performance of a classifier can often be improved significantly, in particular when data is limited. Alternatively, it can be interesting to identify a minimal set of features for acceptable performance (e.g. due to high costs of collecting/measuring the full set of features). Examining the features most relevant to the classification can also provide valuable insights into the data.\n",
