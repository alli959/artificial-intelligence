    "Problem 1 on this week's assignment is taken from the CS231n machine learning course at Stanford University. Solutions to the problem are easily available on the web but I trust that you will not look them up and solve the problem on your own (feel free to collaborate though). This problem will take some time, but when you do complete it you will have acquired a solid understanding of the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks. The second problem is more straightforward. Its solution depends on the Keras package though and you therefore have to install TensorFlow use Google's Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please provide your solutions by filling in the appropriate cells in this notebook, creating new cells as needed. Hand in your solution on Gradescope, taking care to locate the appropriate page numbers in the PDF document. Make sure that you are familiar with the course rules on collaboration (encouraged) and copying (very, very, bad)."

    "In this problem you will implement a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and use it to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The hidden layer has weights $W_1$ and biases $b_1$, and the output layer has weights $W_2$ and biases $b_2$. The nodes in the hidden layer use ReLU activation, $g(z)=\\max(0,z)$ and the output layer uses the vector valued softmax function,\n",

It transforms the values in $z$ (called class scores) to values between zero and one that sum to one. The $f$ values can then be interpreted as class probabilities during prediction.\n",
